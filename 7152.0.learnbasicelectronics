Many people  memorize the theory but have very little hands on experience actually working with these circuits on their own. This experience is what will separate YOU from those who have only memorized enough theory to pass an exam or a class.

I teach basic electronics using a different, laid back approach. Can you tell? Starting at the very beginning, so <u>no prior knowledge of electronics is required</u>, I break everything down into small bite size topics, kind of like my breakfast. 
<br /><br />
Now you get to take all the time you
need to do an experiment yourself. Not like lab class at school where you have to get it all done in an hour or two. </p> 
<p align="left">
For example, after I explain the relationship between voltage and resistance I give you a
diagram and step by step pictures for a simple circuit  that shows how this principle works in real life.</p>  
<p align="left">
There's no pressure from me, from other students or teachers, nor are there any time limits or even any clocks!
(except for your own of course) 
<br /><br />
I show you how do it on your own, you will be using your own work area, your own tools and doing it all in your own home.</p>
